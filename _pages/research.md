### Research
My research interests lie at the intersection of physics-based modeling of cell/tissue mechanics, soft actuating materials and fluid-structure interactions.
Current and past research projects include:
- Bouyancy-driven motion of active elastic micro-structures (Lattice-Boltzman-Immersed-Boundary simulations)
- Continuum modeling for rheology of cell cytoskeleton
- Continuum modeling for rheology of cell cytoskeleton
